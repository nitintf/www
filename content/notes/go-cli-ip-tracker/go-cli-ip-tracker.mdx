Go, a popular programming language, is celebrated for its simplicity, speed, and
reliability, making it perfect for crafting command-line tools.

Building a CLI tool involves handling command line inputs, outputs, and other
system resources. As your app grows, managing this complexity can get tricky.

Enter [Cobra](https://cobra.dev/), a fantastic Go library. It simplifies
building scalable, maintainable, and extensible command-line interfaces.

In this tutorial, I'll guide you through using Cobra to create a Go CLI tool.
We'll focus on building an Ip Tracker tool to effortlessly track IP addresses.
Let's explore Cobra's key features and benefits along the way!

### Prerequisites

<callout-info>
	- Basic understanding of Go programming. - If you're new to Go, check out the
	[official Go tutorial](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1). - Ensure you have
	Go version 1.19 or above installed. You can download it
	[here](https://golang.org/dl/).
</callout-info>

## Install Cobra Generator:

To streamline the integration of Cobra into your application, we recommend using
the Cobra CLI. Install it effortlessly with the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/spf13/cobra-cli@latest
```

Once installed, access the CLI by typing `cobra-cli` in the terminal.

## Create a New Project:

Start by setting up the project directory. Execute the following commands to
create a new folder for your application and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir ip_tracker && cd ip_tracker
```

Now, initiate a Go module for your project:

```bash
go mod init iptracker
```

With the module in place, create the application using the Cobra CLI

```bash
cobra-cli init
```

## Adding Commands:

In the world of CLIs, commands are like the heartbeats—they do things. They're
the main players in your application, each representing a specific action.

Every Cobra app has a root command. When you say the CLI's name, this command
wakes up. Normally, it shares info about the app, but you can make it do
something special. You'll find this root command in `cmd/root.go`. Open it up
and make it look like this:

```go
package cmd

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/spf13/cobra"
	"os"
)

var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "iptracker",
	Short: "Track IP addresses",
	Long:  `A Go based CLI tool to track IP addresses`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		fmt.Println("Welcome to iptracker_cli!")
	},
}

func Execute() {
	if err := rootCmd.Execute(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

func init() {}
```

Now you need to call this `Execute` in the `main.go` file in the root dir.

```go
package main

import "github.com/nitintf/iptracker/cmd"

func main() {
	cmd.Execute()
}
```

The `Execute` function is responsible for running the root command of the CLI
tool. It calls `rootCmd.Execute()`, which initiates the execution of the command
and any sub-commands. If an error occurs during execution, the function exits
the program with an exit status of 1.

<callout-warning class='aside'>This function is typically found in the main file
of your Go application. It acts as the entry point, ensuring that the Cobra
commands are executed appropriately.</callout-warning>

The `init` function is a special Go function that is automatically called before
the `main` function is executed. In this case, the `init` function is currently
empty, but you can use it for any initialization code that needs to run before
the CLI tool starts.

<callout-warning class='aside'>Common use cases for the init function include
setting up configuration, initializing variables, or registering flags or
subcommands. If your application doesn't require any specific initialization at
this stage, the init function can remain empty or you can remove
it.</callout-warning>

## Root Command: What Happends on Execution

In the heart of our CLI is the root command. This command comes to life when we
call our CLI name `iptracker`. Let's break down what happens when this command
is executed in the `cmd/root.go`file:

```go
Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
    ipAdd, err := getPrivateIpAddress()

    if err != nil {
        print.Error("Unable to retrieve Private IP Address")
    }

    publicIpAddr, err := getPublicIPAddress()

    if err != nil {
        print.Error("Unable to retrieve Public IP Address")
        return
    }

    print.Info("\nPrivate IP Address: " + ipAdd)
    ip.ShowIpData(publicIpAddr)
},
```

### Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Get Private IP Address:

   - Call getPrivateIpAddress to obtain the private IP address.
   - Print an error message if there's an issue.

2. Get Public IP Address:

   - Call getPublicIPAddress to obtain the public IP address using an external
     API.
   - Print an error message and exit if there's an issue.

3. Display Information:
   - If both private and public IP addresses are successfully obtained, print
     the private IP address.
   - Call
     [ip.ShowIpData](https://github.com/nitintf/iptracker-cli/blob/main/internal/ip/ip.go)
     to display information about the public IP address.

## Implementing IP Address Retrieval Functions

Now that we've laid the groundwork for our 'iptracker_cli' project, it's time to
implement the functions responsible for fetching both private and public IP
addresses.

```go
type PublicIp struct {
	Origin string `json:"origin"`
}

func getPublicIPAddress() (string, error) {
    resp, err := http.Get("http://httpbin.org/ip")
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    data := PublicIp{}

    err = json.Unmarshal(body, &data)

    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    return data.Origin, nil
}
```

In this function:

- We make an HTTP request to http://httpbin.org/ip.
- Read the response body and use JSON unmarshaling to extract the public IP
  address.
- Return the public IP address and any potential errors.

```go
func getPrivateIpAddress() (string, error) {
    addrs, err := net.InterfaceAddrs()

    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    var ipAddress string

    for _, address := range addrs {
        if ipnet, ok := address.(*net.IPNet); ok && !ipnet.IP.IsLoopback() {
            if ipnet.IP.To4() != nil {
                ipAddress = ipnet.IP.String()
                break
            }
        }
    }

    if ipAddress == "" {
        return "", err
    }

    return ipAddress, nil
}
```

Here's what happens in this function:

- We use `net.InterfaceAddrs()` to retrieve network interface addresses.
- Iterate through these addresses, filtering out loopback and multicast
  addresses.
- Return the first `IPv4` address found, which represents the private IP
  address.

With these functions in place, it's time to put `iptracker` to test. now, your
'iptracker' is ready to be executed. Simply call the following commands:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Introducing the `track` Sub-Command

Now, let's enhance the capabilities of our `iptracker` with a sleek new
sub-command: `track` subcommand allows you to track an IP address instead of
getting your own IP address. It takes a single argument - the IP address.

### Creating the 'track' Sub-Command

```bash
# Create a new file in cmd for our new command

touch cmd/track.go
```

Let's add basic cobra arguments to it

```go
package cmd

import (
	"regexp"

	"github.com/nitintf/iptracker/internal/ip"
	"github.com/nitintf/iptracker/internal/print"
	"github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

var trackCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "track",
	Short: "Track IP address information",
	Long:  `sub-command for the IP address CLI tool, allowing you to track and gather information about a specific IP address`,
	Args:  cobra.ExactArgs(1),
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(trackCmd)
}
```

<callout-info class='aside'>Behind the scenes, in the `init()` function, we're
essentially saying, "Hey, `iptracker` meet `track`. This makes `track` part of
the big family, making it easy for you to use commands like
`iptracker track <IP_ADDRESS>`. It's like giving our CLI a new skill, allowing
you to explore specific IP addresses effortlessly. </callout-info>

Now, add this to our `track` root method

```go {17-29}
package cmd

import (
	"regexp"

	"github.com/nitintf/iptracker/internal/ip"
	"github.com/nitintf/iptracker/internal/print"
	"github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

var trackCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "track",
	Short: "Track IP address information",
	Long:  `sub-command for the IP address CLI tool, allowing you to track and gather information about a specific IP address`,
	Args:  cobra.ExactArgs(1),
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
    if len(args) > 0 {
			ipAdd := args[0]
			isValid := isValidIPAddress(ipAdd)

			if isValid {
				ip.ShowIpData(ipAdd)
			} else {
				print.Error("Invalid IP address.")
			}
		} else {
			print.Error("Please provide IP to trace.")
		}
  },
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(trackCmd)
}
```

### Executing the 'track' Sub-Command

To execute the `track` subcommand and see its functionality in action, you can
run the following command from your terminal:

```bash
go run main.go track 8.8.8.8
```

## Install the CLI

At the moment, you have to run the main.go file in order to run your commands.
However, there’s one more thing you can do to access your commands without even
accessing your code. You can build your application as an executable binary and
install it to your $GOPATH/bin folder. Do this by running the following
commands.

```bash
go build main.go
go install
```

Now, run your application by typing in the following command.

```bash
iptracker
# OR iptracker track <IP_ADDRESS>
```

## There you go!

You have now created a simple `iptracker` CLI using Cobra and Go that can be
used to get information about an IP Address. That's it for this tutorial on
creating a simple `Go` based Command Line Interface (CLI). I hope that helps
inspire you to create more CLI tools and explore the vast possibilities of Go
and Cobra.
